#  ☂️ Umbrella-UI

Congrats! You just saved yourself hours of work by bootstrapping this library. This is mostly a personal project focusing on half-headless and half-designed components and other nice and friendly libraries.

> This setup is meant  for easy development with use of classNames to change styling (semi-headless). This library also contains other useful libraries such as: `react-hook-form`, `@headlessui/react`, `react-loading-skeleton`, `react-loader-spinner`, `recharts`.
